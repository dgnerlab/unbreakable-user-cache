# Unbreakable User Cache
<a href="https://github.com/dgnerlab/wp-rocket-unbreakable-user-cache">Unbreakable User Cache</a> 💪🏻 is a snippet to better handle <a href="https://docs.wp-rocket.me/article/313-user-cache">'User Cache - WP Rocket'</a> using <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_query_arg/">query string</a>.
This simple snippet was made by a fan of <a href="https://wp-rocket.me/">WP Rocket</a>. But, any plugin that can cache query string can do the same.

# What is it?
This simple snippet has only three functions.
1. The Query String '/?login=yes' is added to the login user's Permalink.
2. When non-login users access the '/?login=yes' path, they are forcibly redirected to the homepage.
3. Use WordPress' 'init' and 'template_redirect' features appropriately to avoid overlapping caches.

Sorry, that's all! 😂 But it can do some pretty fun stuff. <a href="#-for-example">For example</a>...
