# Unbreakable User Permalink (for User Cache)
<a href="https://github.com/dgnerlab/unbreakable-user-permalink">Unbreakable User Permalink</a> üí™üèª is a snippet to better handle <a href="https://docs.wp-rocket.me/article/313-user-cache">'User Cache - WP Rocket'</a> using <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_query_arg/">Query string</a>.
This simple snippet was made by a fan of <a href="https://wp-rocket.me/">WP Rocket</a>. But, any plugin that can Cache query string can do the same.

# üëÄ What is it?
This simple snippet has only three features.
* The Query string '/?login=yes' is added to the login user's Permalink.
* When non-login users access the '/?login=yes' path, they are forcibly redirected to the homepage.
* To avoid nesting, WordPress 'init' and 'template_redirect' functions have been used appropriately.

Sorry, that's all! üòÇ But it can do some pretty fun stuff. <a href="#-for-example">For example ‚Üí</a>

The problem with the page Cache is that it is difficult to differentiate between logged in and non-logged in users. Because they share the same Permalink, it's hard to physically break them into separate pages. There is a way to utilize Cookie, but it is not simple. Therefore, the <a href="https://github.com/dgnerlab/unbreakable-user-permalink">Unbreakable User Permalink</a> can be divided into separate pages by appending the '/login=yes' query string to the logged in user's Permalink.

Cache plugin must support Query string page Cache.
Here are the benefits:
* Separate pages for logged in users and non-logged users. Therefore, the Cache file is created separately.
* This solves the Cache nesting issue where logged in users see Cache pages for non-logged in users.
* Cache files of logged in users are well preserved. Avoid unnecessary creation and save server resources.
* This snippet only affects frontend pages. Important files such as robots.txt sitemap.xml are not affected.
* When using network services like Cloudflare, you can specify page rules for logged in users. (Do without Cookie)
* User Cache can be preloaded using <a href="https://github.com/wp-media/wp-rocket-helpers/tree/master/cache/wp-rocket-cache-common-cache-loggedin">Common Cache for Logged in Users</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wp-media/wp-rocket-helpers/tree/master/cache/wp-rocket-no-cache-for-admins">No Cache for Admin</a>. As a result, the page loading speed is also faster for logged in users. <a href="#learn-more">Learn more ‚Üí</a>

For logged in users, preloading is almost impossible because cached pages are difficult to preserve. However, if you use the two plugins(Author: WP Rocket Support Team) below with Unbreakable User Permalink, you can also preload the cache of the logged in user.

> Caution! It is only recommended for professionals who can directly verify and test the generated page Cache file.

* <a href="https://github.com/wp-media/wp-rocket-helpers/tree/master/cache/wp-rocket-no-cache-for-admins">No Cache for Admin</a>

Common Cache for Logged in Users literally creates only one cache file for the logged in user. So, if someone saves a cache file even once, preloading is realized because other users can equally use that cache file. However, if user A's profile image is stored on a cached page, it may be displayed incorrectly to user B. Therefore, pages with profile images should be excluded from the Cache list. Or, you must have the expertise to only objectify your profile image.

Common Cache for Logged in Users can be used independently, but permalink remains the same. This can lead to cache nesting issues where logged in users can see Cache pages for non-logged in users.
